Hi Erich, I have forwarded your query onto our bioinformatician.
There are a few nifty tools we use here.
I use a program called fastqc
(http://www.bioinformatics.bbsrc.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) to determine the
overall quality of my fastq reads. Based on the report I trim my fastq reads
back, it is almost always back to 50 bp (using 76 bp output from the
machine). 
I also perform a search for adapters
This is the usual culprit on the 3' end
GATCGGAAGAGCGGTTCAGCAGGAATGCCG
So a search for (grep "GATCGGAAGAGCGG") usually finds quite a few adapters
(depending on the quality of library prep). I once found this adapter in 95%
of my reads!!!!!
Ross Hall has perl scripts for removing the adapters and trimming fastq
reads. He will be in touch shortly. Ross and Aaron Jex have also been
working on a script that will remove redundancy from the libraries prior to
assembly. This may also be of use to you.
Good luck!
Best regards,
Neil
